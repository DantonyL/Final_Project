```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Question / Hypothesis

Loss ofÂ *PHYA*, PHYB, CRYP1, CRYP2 (photoreceptorsL phytochrome, cryptochrome) promotes growth in light responsive gene networks in Arabadopsis thailania.

```{r cars}

```

## Techniques Used

Linear Model - p values and anova( F )

Tukey's (HSD) Test - determine which group means are significantly different from each other (mutants differ from mutant or WT)

AIC Table/Graph - use Delta to find difference from best model, plot shows model-averaged predictions

MA Plot (limma) - Asses gene expression (PhyB), see how much differently the two genes are expressed.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
